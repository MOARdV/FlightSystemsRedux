# FlightSystemsRedux
RasterPropMonitor-enabled IVA configurations for the Kerbal Space Program

## ATTENTION

This mod is obsolete.  It was last updated for KSP 1.1.3.  Many changes have taken place with the RasterPropMonitor mod and the props used in this mod since then.  Do not expect the IVAs included here to be usable without a lot of effort.  I will not be releasing updates for this mod, since I have moved to MOARdV's Avionics Systems for enabling IVA gameplay in KSP.

## Overview

FlightSystemsRedux is a mod that contains updated RasterPropMonitor IVA configurations for use in KSP.
It is a revision and update of the FASA Gemini Modernization 2.0 from 2014, and it provides a
way to showcase RasterPropMonitor capabilities without resorting to all-glass cockpits.

## Requirements

The following are all requirements for using FlightSystemsRedux (and not included in this package):

* Kerbal Space Program v1.1.3 or later
* [ASET Avionics Pack](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129364) v1.0 or later
* [ASET Props Pack](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129305) v1.3 or later
* [Module Manager](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219) v2.6.25 or later
* [RasterPropMonitor](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117471) v0.27.0 or later

In addition, one or both of these mods is needed to use the existing IVAs.
* [FASA](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24867) v5.40 or later for the FASA Gemini pod
* [Yarbrough Mk. 1-1 A2](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/88604-wip-105-2-kerbal-command-pod-mk-1-1-a2-alpha-04-spacedock/) Alpha 0.4 or later for the Yarbrough Mk. 1-1 A2 pod

Earlier versions of the listed mods may work, but such configurations are untested and unsupported.

These IVAs have additional functionality when the following mods are installed:

* [Kerbal Alarm Clock](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/22809-10x-kerbal-alarm-clock-v3500-dec-3/) - adds the ability to view the time until the next Kerbal Alarm Clock alarm triggers when using the auxiliary digital timer.
* [MechJeb](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/111978-105-anatid-robotics-mumech-mechjeb-autopilot-256-23-feb-2016/) - adds launch, landing, maneuver node, and rendezvous autopilots, Smart A.S.S. functionality, as well as the ability to configure launch parameters, orbit changes, and rendezvous maneuvers.
* [RealChute](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/52931-10511wenkel-corporation-realchute-parachute-systems-v14x3-020416-11-prerelease-available/) - adds the ability to arm RealChute parachutes for deployment, in addition to deploying parachutes.

As of version 4.1.0 of this mod, the FASA Gemini pod has been moved to legacy status.  There have been no updates to the IVA to take
advantage of the latest ASET props and RasterPropMonitor, and all relevant components have been moved to the Legacy folder.
The IVA may not work correctly (an update will take place later; pull requests with fixes are welcome if someone doesn't want
to wait).

## Installation

Merge the GameData folder in this archive with the GameData folder in your KSP installation.  The contents of this archive do not overwrite existing files anywhere but GameData/MOARdV/FlightSystemsRedux.

Removing this mod is as simple as deleting the GameData/MOARdV/FlightSystemsRedux folder.

If you are not using the FASA Gemini pod, you may safely delete the GameData/MOARdV/FlightSystemsRedux/Legacy folder.

## Usage

TL;DR: start playing.  Almost everything is clickable, or it provides information.  The IVA is retrofitted to existing flights, even, so there's no danger to existing save games.

Long version: Visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/MOARdV/FlightSystemsRedux/wiki) for this mod for detailed descriptions.

## Manifest

What's included in this package?

* Module Manager configs to replace the props in the FASA Gemini capsule and the Yarbrough Mk. 1-1 A2 capsule, updating those pods with new interiors.
* Module Manager configs to modify the FASA Gemini nose cones with docking port cameras and a radar module to allow target acquisition.
* Module Manager configs to add cameras to the FASA Probe Camera, converting it into a RasterPropMonitor-enabled camera.
* Many MOARdV customized configurations of existing ASET Props and ASET Avionics parts.

Other directories contain configurations for MFDs, replacement textures used for customized props, et cetera.

# FlightSystemsRedux
RasterPropMonitor-enabled IVA configurations for the Kerbal Space Program

## Overview

FlightSystemsRedux is a mod that contains updated RasterPropMonitor IVA configurations for use in KSP.
It is a revision and update of the FASA Gemini Modernization 2.0 from 2014, and it provides a
way to showcase RasterPropMonitor capabilities without resorting to all-glass cockpits.

Also included are many ASET props created by alexustas that have not been released into the ASET Props Pack
or ASET Avionics Pack.

## Requirements

The following are all requirements for using FlightSystemsRedux (and not included in this package):

* Kerbal Space Program v1.1.0 or later
* [ASET Avionics Pack](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129364) v1.0 or later
* [ASET Props Pack](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129305) v1.3 or later
* [Module Manager](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219) v2.6.21 or later
* [RasterPropMonitor](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117471) v0.25.0 or later

In addition, one or both of these mods is needed to use the existing IVAs.
* [FASA](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24867) v5.40 or later for the FASA Gemini pod
* [Yarbrough Mk. 1-1 A2](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/88604-wip-105-2-kerbal-command-pod-mk-1-1-a2-alpha-04-spacedock/) Alpha 0.4 or later for the Yarbrough Mk. 1-1 A2 pod

Earlier versions of the listed mods may work, but such configurations are untested and unsupported.

## Installation

Merge the GameData folder in this archive with the GameData folder in your KSP installation.  The contents of this archive do not overwrite existing files anywhere but GameData/MOARdV/FlightSystemsRedux.

If you have a legacy version of the Gemini replacement IVA (version 2.0 or earlier), you should delete it.  It is not fully compatible with current versions of RasterPropMonitor.

Removing this mod is as simple as deleting the GameData/MOARdV/FlightSystemsRedux folder.

## Usage

TL;DR: start playing.  Almost everything is clickable, or it provides information.  The IVA is retrofitted to existing flights, even, so there's no danger to existing save games.
